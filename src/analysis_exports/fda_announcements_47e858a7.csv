alert,The FDA is aware of the emerging shortage and is working closely with stakeholders to resolve disruptions. Stakeholders are encouraged to report supply issues and coordinate on capacity adjustments. We are monitoring the situation closely.,elevated,2025-07-30T12:58:39.804856,2,"{'shortage_assessment': 'The shortage is emerging with insufficient supply adequacy and requires attention to prevent further escalation. There is one reported manufacturer disruption contributing to the supply issues.', 'intervention_justification': 'An alert level response is appropriate to provide guidance and transparency, encouraging voluntary industry coordination without causing undue alarm that could prompt panic buying.', 'market_impact_prediction': 'Manufacturers are likely to assess capacity expansions while buyers adopt prudent resource management. It balances transparency with market stability, avoiding the risk of exacerbated disruptions.', 'patient_safety_considerations': 'There is moderate risk to patient safety if unaddressed, and clear communication may mitigate this risk by fostering swift stakeholder coordination.'}"
alert,The FDA is issuing a shortage alert for a medicine with current supply disruptions. We encourage manufacturers to increase production and buyers to refrain from stockpiling.
