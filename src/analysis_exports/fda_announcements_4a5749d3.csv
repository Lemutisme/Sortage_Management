monitoring,The FDA is monitoring an emerging drug shortage and encourages healthcare providers to report any supply issues. We invite manufacturers to coordinate with us to ensure patient safety and supply continuity.,elevated,2025-07-30T09:24:44.867410,1,"{'shortage_assessment': 'The shortage is emerging with one manufacturer disruption, and current conditions indicate insufficient supply. There are early signs of coordination problems, but the intervention threshold is not yet met for a formal alert.', 'intervention_justification': ""A monitoring statement is appropriate to raise awareness without triggering panic buying. Encouraging voluntary reporting and early coordination may help mitigate the shortage's impact."", 'market_impact_prediction': 'Manufacturers may begin to increase production capacity in response to the monitoring statement. Buyers are less likely to engage in stockpiling given the lack of a critical shortage alert, maintaining market stability.', 'patient_safety_considerations': 'There is a moderate clinical impact risk due to potential shortages, but early communication may help alleviate access concerns without undue alarm.'}"
