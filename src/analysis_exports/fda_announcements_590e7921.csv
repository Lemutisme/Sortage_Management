There is one known manufacturer disruption contributing to the issue.', 'intervention_justification': 'A monitoring statement is appropriate to acknowledge the situation and encourage voluntary reporting without causing panic buying. This level of response is suitable given the current low to moderate patient safety risk and the potential for coordination to mitigate market failures.', 'market_impact_prediction': 'The announcement is expected to encourage manufacturers to assess their capacity and report issues while discouraging buyers from stockpiling. It should help stabilize the market by facilitating industry coordination.', 'patient_safety_considerations': 'The patient safety risk is currently low to moderate, and there is no immediate clinical urgency. However, maintaining access to medications is important, and this communication aims to prevent further disruptions.'}"
